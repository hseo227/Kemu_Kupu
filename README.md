## How to Launch the Game
This game will help you learn and practice the spelling of Māori words.

To play this game: <br/>
  - First, give it executable permission <br/>
      `> chmod +x run.sh`
  - Then run <br/>
      `> ./run.sh`

## Instructions
`Check 'User Manual' for more detailed information.`

You are able to choose either to **PLAY** or **PRACTICE**. <br/>
Both options will ask you to choose a topic you would like to be tested on. <br/>
You can adjust the *playback speed* with the button on the top left corner. <br/>
You may also hear the word as many times as you want by clicking the *replay* button. <br/>

### PLAY
Each round will test you on **5** words. <br/>
You will be timed for ranking purposes for the *Leaderboard*. <br/>
At the end of each round, you will be shown the words you have been tested on, and <br/>
also the *Leaderboard*. <br/>

### PRACTICE
You are able to choose how many words you would like to be tested on. <br/>
Practice rounds will be timed, but not ranked. <br/>
Similarly to PLAY mode, you will be shown the words you have been tested on, but <br/>
no leaderboard exists for practice rounds.

### Score System
If you are correct on your first try, you will get **20** points! <br/>
If you managed to get it correct on your second try, you will get **10** points! <br/>
You can also **skip** words, and the game will assume that you got the word wrong. <br/>
